# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]

**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Code Quality**: Identify affected modules, simplifications, TypeScript or
  interface boundaries, lint/format checks, and any new abstraction that needs
  explicit justification.
- **Testing**: List the unit, integration, regression, and screen-flow or end-to-end
  tests required to prove the mobile journey. If any automated coverage cannot be
  added, document why and define the manual verification plan.
- **UX Consistency**: Describe impacted user flows, confirm reuse of existing
  interaction and copy patterns, and list loading, empty, success, validation error,
  and sync-conflict states across Android and iOS.
- **Offline, Security, and Performance**: Define the local storage behavior, sync
  and conflict-resolution rules, encryption or sensitive-data handling needs, and the
  measurable performance budgets or non-regression thresholds for the affected path.
- **Observability and Reviewability**: Record required logs, metrics, feature flags,
  rollout notes, and any dependency or risk that reviewers must inspect without
  exposing sensitive financial data.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
